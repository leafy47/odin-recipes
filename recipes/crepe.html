    <h2>What is Crepe Suzette</h2>
    <p>While restaurants traditionally make the buttery, orange-flavored sauce for this famous dessert tableside from start to finish, this recipe from Jacques Pépin is ideal for entertaining a group at home. You can prepare all the crêpes in advance, and when it’s time to serve, dip the crêpes in the orange butter sauce and then add them to a large skillet with the liquor. Pépin flambés the liquor in front of his dinner guests and pours it over the platter of crêpes while still flaming.</p>
