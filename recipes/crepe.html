    <h2>What is Crepe Suzette?</h2>
    <p>While restaurants traditionally make the buttery, orange-flavored sauce for this famous dessert tableside from start to finish, this recipe from Jacques Pépin is ideal for entertaining a group at home. You can prepare all the crêpes in advance, and when it’s time to serve, dip the crêpes in the orange butter sauce and then add them to a large skillet with the liquor. Pépin flambés the liquor in front of his dinner guests and pours it over the platter of crêpes while still flaming.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <h3>Crepes</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 large eggs</li>
        <li>3/4 cup all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1/2 cup whole milk</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon granulated sugar</li>
        <li>1/8 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
        <li>1/3 cup cold water</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon canola oil</li>
        <LI>1 tablespoon unsalted butter, melted, plus more for skillet</LI>
    </ul>
    <h3>Orange-Butter Sauce</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1/2 cup unsalted butter (4 ounces), softened</li>
        <li>1/3 cup plus 2 tablespoons granulated sugar, divided</li>
        <li>1/2 tablespoon finely grated orange zest</li>
        <li>1/3 cup fresh orange juice (from about 2 medium oranges)</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons (1 1/2 ounces) orange liqueur (such as Grand Marnier or Cointreau)</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon (1/2 ounce) Cognac</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Make the crêpes: Whisk together eggs, flour, milk, sugar, and salt in a medium bowl until smooth; batter will be thick. Whisk in water, oil, and melted butter until well combined.</li>
        <li>Heat a 10-inch crêpe pan or nonstick skillet over medium-high and brush with butter. Add 3 tablespoons batter and quickly tilt skillet to evenly distribute batter. Cook until the edges of the crêpe curl up and start to brown, about 45 seconds. Flip the crêpe using a long spatula; cook until a few brown spots appear on the bottom, 10 to 15 seconds. Transfer the crêpe to a baking sheet. Repeat process with remaining batter to make about nine more crêpes, wiping skillet clean and lightly buttering skillet a few times as necessary between crêpes.</li>
        <li>Make the orange-butter sauce: Process butter, 1/3 cup sugar, and orange zest in a food processor. With processor running, gradually add orange juice until incorporated.</li>
        <li>Spoon butter mixture into a 12-inch flameproof skillet; cook over medium, stirring occasionally, until bubbling, 2 to 3 minutes. Continue to cook, stirring occasionally, until mixture is syrupy, about 3 minutes. Reduce heat to low. Working with 1 crêpe at a time, dip both sides of crêpe in sauce using 2 forks or silicone spatulas; fold into fourths with prettiest side facing outward. Lift and let excess sauce drip off; transfer folded crêpe to a baking sheet. Repeat process with remaining crêpes, scraping down sides of skillet as needed. </li>
        <li>Transfer folded crêpes back to skillet, overlapping slightly as needed to fit all 10 crêpes in skillet; scrape any excess sauce on baking sheet back into skillet. Sprinkle crêpes with remaining 2 tablespoons sugar. Increase heat to medium. Add Grand Marnier and cognac; carefully ignite sauce using a long-handled lighter. Carefully spoon flaming sauce over crêpes using a long-handled, heatproof spoon until flames subside, about 30 seconds. Transfer crêpes to a platter; spoon any extra sauce over top. Serve immediately.</li>
